sjaid cookie expires exactly two months after its request time (according to debugging)
xt cookie expires exactly one day after its request time (according to debugging)
Auth token is two weeks  (according to deprecated docs)

So once every two weeks https://accounts.google.com/ClientLogin is hit for a new AuthToken
When the auth token is valid, we check if xt and sjaid are too. If not we hit https://play.google.com/music/listen?hl=en&u=0 for the cookies again

So ClientLogin is hit once every two weeks listen is hit once a day. This will allow us to save our "session" and reduce requests a lot
